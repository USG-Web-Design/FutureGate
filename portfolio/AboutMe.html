		"                                                         Hello, I am 17 years old and do not yet have a driver's license. I spend the most of my time at school, with school, theater, soccer, golf, pet care club, and rocket team (s). When I'm not at school, I enjoy watching Netfilx or YouTube, cooking or baking, playing with my cat, and learning new things. I enjoy cooking meals from all over the world; I even got an Irish cookbook and ate potatoes for a while. I also like cooking fusion food, such as Mexican-style Kimcki fried rice. It's actually quite good.Because I enjoy learning new things and making things, I want to be an engineer. In ten years, I hope to be a successful engineer with my own company. As a side job, I'd like to own a food truck. And before I complete all of them and become busy, I want to go around the world by myself or with friends. I'd wish to visit Turkey and Mongolia. That is on my bucket list.                            "
