	The hippopotamus, also known as the hippo, is a huge semi-aquatic mammal native to Sub-Saharan Africa. They are famous for their enormous size, weighing up to 3,000 pounds and reaching lengths of up to 16 feet. Hippos, despite their size, are superb swimmers and can hold their breath for up to 5 minutes underwater. They are herbivores in the wild and spend the most of their day in the water to cool down and protect their skin from the sun. They go out to graze on the grass at night. Despite their generally peaceful demeanor, hippos are considered one of the most dangerous animals in Africa due to their aggressive nature and powerful jaws.
