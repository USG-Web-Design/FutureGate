		apologize mail

	</h1>
	<p>
		One night before I go to bed, I got one apologize email from Ellen Heacock. Saying she is sorry for incorrect information that she told us before. The mail was organized with bullet point and highlighted part, which was so Ellen. And the next day, in school, I ask ellen why did she send email instead of telling us in person. And Ellen said.. She never send email.
